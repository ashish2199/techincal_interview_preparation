Selection Sort 
    In the I th iteration go through array find the shortest remaining entry to
    the right of I and swap it with first entry in the array.
    
    Data involvement is minimum â€“ Every item is put into its final order with 
    just one exchange.
    Linear Number of exchanges - O(N) swaps
    
    Stable(does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys) : No
    Online(can sort as it recieves input) : No
    Adaptable(faster for already sorted data) : No, goes through entire data 
                                                irrespective of order. It is 
                                                quadratic for every array.
    Inplace (doesnt require additional space) : Yes

    
Analysis
    Worst Case Running Time : O(N^2)
    Best Case Running Time : O(N^2)
    Space Complexity : O(1)
