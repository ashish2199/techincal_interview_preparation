    Pattern to be printed

    We can observe that it starts from 1 
    Each line has as many numbers as the line number so line 4 has 4 numbers
    In Odd number lines the numbers are incrementing
    In Even numbered lines the numbers are printing in reverse order that is 
    in line number 2,4,6,8 and so on
    
    Input- N the number of line to be printed
    Output- The pattern
